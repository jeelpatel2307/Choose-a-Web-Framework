# Choose a Web Framework in Java

This project provides a framework for evaluating and selecting the most suitable web framework for your Java-based web application.

## Overview

The `WebFrameworkSelector` class is the main entry point of the application. It creates a `WebFrameworkEvaluator` instance and calls the `evaluateFrameworks` method, which evaluates the available web frameworks and selects the best one based on the given criteria.

The `WebFrameworkEvaluator` class manages the list of web frameworks and evaluates them based on the following criteria:

- **Scalability**: The framework's ability to handle increased workloads and traffic.
- **Performance**: The framework's performance in terms of response time and resource utilization.
- **Community**: The size and activity of the framework's community, which influences the availability of resources, support, and third-party libraries.
- **Documentation**: The quality and comprehensiveness of the framework's documentation.
- **Tooling**: The availability and quality of development tools, such as IDEs, build tools, and debugging utilities.

The `WebFramework` abstract class defines the common properties and methods for all web frameworks, and the concrete web framework classes (`SpringFramework`, `JakartaEEFramework`, `PlayFramework`, and `MicronautFramework`) provide their own implementation of the `evaluateFramework` method.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the `WebFrameworkSelector` class, either from your IDE or by running the following command in your terminal:
    
    ```
    java WebFrameworkSelector
    
    ```
    
3. The application will evaluate the available web frameworks and recommend the most suitable one based on the given criteria.

## Benefits

Using this project to choose a web framework provides the following benefits:

1. **Structured Evaluation**: The project provides a structured approach to evaluating and comparing different web frameworks, making the decision-making process more systematic and objective.
2. **Extensibility**: You can easily add more web frameworks to the evaluation process or modify the evaluation criteria to better suit your specific requirements.
3. **Consistency**: By using this project, you can ensure that the web framework selection process is consistent across different projects or teams.
4. **Documentation**: The code itself serves as a detailed guide for the web framework evaluation and selection process.

## Future Enhancements

Here are some potential enhancements that could be made to this project:

- Add more web frameworks to the evaluation process, including newer or less popular options.
- Provide a user interface (UI) or a command-line tool for a more user-friendly experience.
- Integrate the evaluation process with a decision support system or a knowledge base to provide more comprehensive recommendations.
- Implement a scoring system that allows users to assign different weights to the evaluation criteria based on their priorities.
- Provide the ability to save and load evaluation results for future reference or sharing.
